# Pomodoro Timer

## Project Context
A React Native Pomodoro Timer app built with Expo, designed to help users boost productivity using the Pomodoro technique with customizable timers and modern visual feedback.
- Features configurable work and break durations
- Includes audio and haptic feedback for enhanced user interaction
- Uses local storage for settings persistence
- Core timer functionality with modern UI/UX

## Code Style and Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Keep components focused and small
- Use absolute imports with '~/' prefix
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, types
- Use SafeAreaView from react-native-safe-area-context for consistent screen insets
- Follow atomic design principles for component organization

## Tech Stack
- React Native + Expo
- TypeScript
- Nativewind (TailwindCSS)
- Expo Router (file-based routing)
- Expo Audio (sound effects)
- Expo Haptics (vibration feedback)
- AsyncStorage (settings persistence)
- Reanimated (animations)
- Lottie (animations)

## File Structure
- Use Expo Router file-based routing
- Place shared components in src/components
- Keep configuration files in src/config/
- Store types in src/types/
- Place hooks in src/hooks/
- Keep services in src/services/
- Store utilities in src/utils/
- Maintain constants in src/constants/

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Define interfaces for props and state
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use absolute imports with '~/'
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode
- Use type inference when appropriate

## UI and Styling
- Use Nativewind for styling
- Use SafeAreaView for screen insets
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use Expo Vector Icons for icons
- Implement consistent spacing and typography
- Use Linear Gradient for visual effects
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use custom components over React Native/Expo defaults
- Implement proper dark mode support
- Use proper keyboard handling
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle proper error states

## State Management
- Use React's built-in state management (useState, useContext)
- Use AsyncStorage for persistent settings
- Use hooks for component-level state
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle error states gracefully

## Error Handling
- Handle errors early in functions
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Log errors with meaningful messages
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide fallback UI for error states
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle storage errors gracefully

## Performance
- Implement proper memo usage
- Optimize timer accuracy
- Optimize images and assets
- Use proper animation techniques
- Monitor and optimize bundle size
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper asset preloading
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Package Installation
- Use `npx expo install` for installing packages

## Formatting and Linting
- Use ESLint for code linting
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow consistent code style
- Run format checks in CI/CD
- Use proper TypeScript configurations
